### Hi there 👋

I'm an Android Developer👨‍💻 based in Montréal🍁, Canada.

I've published [my 1st open-souce Android app](https://github.com/mmathieum/montrealtransit-for-android) in 2010.

After [rebooting the project](https://github.com/mtransitapps)🔄 in 2014, I'm still working on it!

The [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mtransit.android) is rated 4.5 stars⭐, has been downloaded⬇️ 1M+ times and is frequently in the top 10🏆 of [Maps & Navigation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION) apps in Canada🇨🇦.
