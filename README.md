### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android Developer based in MontrÃ©al, Canada.

I've published [my 1st open-souce Android app](https://github.com/mmathieum/montrealtransit-for-android) in 2010.

After [rebooting the project](https://github.com/mtransitapps) in 2014, I'm still working on it!

The app has been downloaded 500k+ times and is frequently in the top 10 of [Maps & Navigation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION) apps in Canada.
